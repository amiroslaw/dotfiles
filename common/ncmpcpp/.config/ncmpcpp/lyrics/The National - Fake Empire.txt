Stay out super late tonight
Picking apples, making pies
Put a little something in our lemonade
And take it with us

We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire

Tiptoe through our shiny city
With our diamond slippers on
Do our gay ballet on ice
Bluebirds on our shoulders

We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire

Turn the light out, say goodnight
No thinking for a little while
Let's not try to figure out
Everything at once
It's hard to keep track of you
Falling through the sky

We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire
