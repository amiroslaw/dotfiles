Crushed on the train, we'd stand by the window
Sweat through the hard parts of June
We hugged it out and ducked it on purpose
Nothing else I needed to do

I was born, born to beg for you

Later that year in the back of the Warsaw
I thought you and I might be okay
Spinning and quiet, you leaned in against me
Said, "I'm gonna have it all someday."

I was born, born to beg for you
I was born, born to beg for you

I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything

New York is older
And changing its skin again
It dies every ten years
And then it begins again

If your heart was in it
I'd stay a minute
I'm dying to be taken apart

I was born, born to beg for you
I was born to beg for you

I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
