I hear the birds
When they're singing
I hear the sirens
When they're ringing
But I can't take my mind off of you
A thousand words, pouring out
The distance of over there
Is moving on and out
You said it'd be alright

How 'bout these notions
Hmm, they're deep as ocean
Calling out my name
Screaming out in vain
Singing hallelujah

Tell your mother, she don't understand
Tell your mother, she's not listening
Why don't you tear my heart
The chain is made of string
I roll the dice
You seal the deal
That don't matter
Cause pain will heal
I will follow you
Into the dark

How 'bout these notions
Hmm, they're deep as ocean
Calling out my name
Screaming out in vain
Singing hallelujah

These notions
Hmm, they're deep as ocean
Calling out my name
Screaming out in vain
Singing hallelujah

Singing hallelujah to you
Calling out my name
I'm in the deep end, ocean
Calling out my name
Singing hallelujah to you
