Watching girls passing by
It ain't the latest thing
I'm just standing in a doorway
I'm just trying to make some sense
Out of these girls, they're passing by
The tales they tell of men
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend

Oooh, a smile relieves a heart that grieves
Remember what I said
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend

Do do do do do do do do do do, yeah, yeah
Do do do do do do do do do do, yeah, yeah

Don't need a whore
Don't need no booze
Don't need a virgin priest, uh
But I need someone I can cry to
I need someone to protect
Oooh, making love and breaking hearts
It is a game for youth
But, I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend, ha
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend

Do do do do do do do do do do, yeah, yeah
