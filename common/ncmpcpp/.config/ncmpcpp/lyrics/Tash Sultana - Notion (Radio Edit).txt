I see the way you move
It's fluid
Be here by my side
Got nothing to hide

I know that you're hurting
I see the tears behind those eyes
And I can't wipe them clear
Your love is like gold to me

But you hold me closer to the light
You will not find a bullet inside
Unless you magnify

But you throw me into the deep end
Expect me to know how to swim
And I put my faith inside my hands
Cause I will be just fine

[Chorus]
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me
Welcome to the jungle
You got to close your eyes and see
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me
Well hold on
Well hold on

[Alternate Verse]
Suit and tie with the black jeans on
And I’m paralyzed
Cos' I think you got something like the biggest soul I’ve ever seen
And I think you’re the one

Suit and tie, with the curly hair
Making your way with that step and stare
So tell me real, do you feel anything

[Verse]
Ashes to ashes
And the embers are ablaze
Oh, I gotta rise amongst you, though
Then I think about your face every day

But you pull me closer to the light
You wouldn't find a bullet inside
Only if you magnify

[Chorus]
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me
Welcome to the jungle
You got to close your eyes and see
Welcome to the jungle
Are you gonna dance with me
Well hold on
Well hold on
