On the way to California
And I don't mean California literally
I was thinking, it's so comforting quiet
You read so softly over my head
It's late but I'm maintaining interest in the things that you say
I could listen to you speak all day

In the silence dripping wet with
Kisses running down my lips
Could be just a good friend
Who knows at this point anyway

There's just something about the way you surrender your eyes
Without this barrier of bodies, we'd already be inside

Like two children at first glance
We're building castles in the sand
It is so delicately dreamt of
This immediate intimacy

On the way to California
And I don't mean California literally
I was thinking, I was thinking
I'm not dreaming
I'm not dreaming
I'm not dreaming
Not this time anyway
Doo do doo...

I've got a feeling buried deep down inside of me
I've got a feeling buried deep down
And who knows what it means to have a feeling
Buried so deep down
But I've never felt quite so open for love
I've never felt quite so open before
And maybe my imagination runs away with me

You know I don't mind
You know I don't mind
You know I don't mind at all
Oh no... at all
And if you should take me I'd let you break my heart
Oh no...
And if you should take me I'd let you break my heart
Oh... my heart
Oh... my heart
