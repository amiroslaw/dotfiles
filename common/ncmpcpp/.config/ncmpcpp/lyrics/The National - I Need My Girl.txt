I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller

I need my girl
I need my girl

Remember when you lost your shit
And drove the car into the garden?
You got out and said I'm sorry
To the vines and no one saw it

I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was a 45-percenter then
I know I was a lot of things

But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller

I need my girl
I need my girl

There're some things that I should never
Laugh about in front of family
I tried to call you from the party
It's full of punks and cannonballers

I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was a 45-percenter then
I know I was a lot of things

But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
