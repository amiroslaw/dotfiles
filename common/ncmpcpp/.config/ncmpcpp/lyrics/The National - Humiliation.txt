I survived the dinner
Then the air went thinner
I retire to the briars by the pool
It gets so loud

If I die this instant
Taken from a distance
They will probably list it down
Among other things 'round town

Got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down

In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of the white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

All the L.A. women
Fall asleep while swimming
I got paid to fish 'em out
And then one day I lost the job

And I cried a little
I got fried a little
Then she laid her eyes on mine
And she said, "Babe, you're better off."

I got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down

In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of the white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today

As the free fall advances
I'm the moron who dances, ah
I was teething on roses
I was in Guns and Noses, ah

Under the withering white skies of humiliation
Under the withering white skies of humiliation

Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today

She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
