When I think of you in the city
The sight of you among the sights
I get the sudden sinking feeling
Of a man about to fly

It never kept me up before
Now I've been awake for days
I can't fight it anymore
I'm going through an awkward phase

I am secretly in love with
Everyone that I grew up with
Do my crying underwater
I can't get down any farther

All my drowning friends can see
Now there is no running from it
It's become the crux of me
I wish that I could rise above it

But I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons

Bats and buzzards in the sky
Alligators in the sewers
I don't even wonder why
Hide among the younger viewers

Huddle with them all night long
The worried talk to God goes on
I sincerely tried to love it
I wish that I could rise above it

But I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons

Can I stay here? I can sleep on the floor
Paint the blood and hang the palms on the door
I do not think I'm going places anymore
I wanna see the sun come up above New York

Oh, every day I start so great
And then the sunlight dims
The less I look the more I see
The pythons in the limbs

Do not know what's wrong with me
The sour is in the cut
When I walk into a room
I do not light it up
Fuck

So I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
