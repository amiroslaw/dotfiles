You will discover me through my songs
Learn my heartbreaks and fears and depression
Hear all the cracks and the lack of talent
And I hope that you don't hate me by then X2

I know that it's true
I know you feel it too
Together we will learn
To make everything new

I only wanna share new things
New stories and new kisses
I don't wanna do over what I failed at before
I just wanna make it new with you X2

Teach me how to be yours
Teach me all that is you
What is past is past
What is new will last

And you will start to think I'm boring
'Cause I'm straight edge since I'm 18
But I will write you songs just to prove you that I love you
And I hope that you don't hate me by then X2

'Cause I just wanna make it new with you
