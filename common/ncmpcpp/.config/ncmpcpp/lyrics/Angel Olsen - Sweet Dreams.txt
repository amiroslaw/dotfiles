Every time I close my eyes
Something small within me dies
Can't say if it's dark or bright
But it's all I've ever known
And when I sleep, I sleep alone
Alone
Alone

Every time I take a breath
Something once living inside me has left
Yes it's alive but it's just passed through
It's just left me and it's just left you
On your own
On your own

And I love you most
I love you most
When I first found love in my soul
And I'll give to you
Give it up to you
When I first find it in myself
And the time will come for everyone
For everyone to know
Yes the time will come for everyone
For everyone to go

And say goodbye
And say goodbye
And say goodbye
Sweet dreams
Sleep tight
Sleep tight
