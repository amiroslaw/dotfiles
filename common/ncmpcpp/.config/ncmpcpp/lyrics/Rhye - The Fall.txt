Uuh, make love to me
One more time
Before you go away
Why can't you stay?

Uuh, my love
Come home to me
Just for a while
I'll leave this piece of me
Why can't you stay?

Don't run away
Don't slip away my dear
Don't run away
Don't slip away my dear
Don't run away
(Don't ruin this heart of mine)

The song is gone
It fell into the fall
But I don't want it this way
Why can't you stay?

Don't run away
Don't slip away my dear
Don't run away
Don't slip away my dear
Don't run away
(Don't ruin this heart of mine)
Ohh ohh

There should be words
There should be words that explain the way
But I am tongue tied and twisted
Where's those words...

Don't run away
Don't slip away my dear
