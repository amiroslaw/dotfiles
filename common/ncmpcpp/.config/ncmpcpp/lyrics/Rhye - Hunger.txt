I'm all alone, just feel like a shadow
Cold face, I'm stuck in this stage
Tangled myself, this ...burns
Caught in this... thang

Hungry in the south, made for all sense
Can you hear the sound,
It's calling through the ground
On the ground

I'll show my teeth
Pull a soft from the sheets

Started to bruise
Done outside of your face
Thought it was made for us
Now we're eating our own eyes
Thought it was made for us
Now we're eating our own eyes

Hungry in the south, made for all sense
Can you hear the sound,
It's calling through the ground
On the ground.
