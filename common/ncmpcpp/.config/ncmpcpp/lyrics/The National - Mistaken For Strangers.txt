You have to do it running but you do everything that they ask you to
'Cause you don't mind seeing yourself in a picture
As long as you look far away
As long as you look removed

Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters

You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes glazing under
Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another uninnocent, elegant fall into the unmagnificent lives of adults

Make up something to believe in your heart of hearts
So you have something to wear on your sleeve of sleeves
So you swear you just saw a feathery woman
Carry a blindfolded man through the trees

Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters

You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes glazing under
Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another uninnocent, elegant fall into the unmagnificent lives of adults
You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes glazing under
Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another uninnocent, elegant fall into the unmagnificent lives of adults
