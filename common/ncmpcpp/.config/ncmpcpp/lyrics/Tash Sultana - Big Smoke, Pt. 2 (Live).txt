This is where you fuck with the dude in the front row.
He's getting way into it. That's you bro.
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
l keep him holding on
I do feign love
I keep him holding on all night long
I keep on running into the faces and the places in between
I'm all young and I guess a young queen
Put your head down low, put your hands up high
Don't try to touch me, I'm electrified
Para[?]

Are you ready? That's not good enough.
Are you ready?

Testing.

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the motherland
Where the sun gonna meet the sand
Welcome to Babylon
Primeval magic that we all come from
'Cause I [been there?]
got down on my knees
No don't tell me please
'Cause I've seen the door before and I swear to god
I don't want to  feel that way no more
No else, no I won't, not for you

[Refrain]
And you're gonna run for your life?
And you're gonna run [?]

[Verse 3]
Start each day [? 5:50]
Put your face in my hands all the time
What a beautiful day to start the same day again
Not the kind of boy that knows how gotta leave you [?]
I gotta leave you a note
What am I supposed to do? Me and you
When the big smoke comes, I gotta run
Far away from all your problems
Got a [?] about to do [?]

[Refrain]
And you're gonna run [far away?]
And you're gonna run [?]
Para[?]

I'm just fucking with you.
Yeah!

I keep him holding on, until we find love
Keep him holding on, I don't know
Keep on running to the faces and places in between
[?] I [?] queen
