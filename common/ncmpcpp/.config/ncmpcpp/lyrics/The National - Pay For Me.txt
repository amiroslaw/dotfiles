I thought I'd come and see you
And your long lazy scene
Instate direction
Finger on a magazine
I'd call you when I need you
I can't get used to your new name

Send a body double
Over with your keys
She'll see you in an hour
Everybody quiet, please
Essex House is down the road
The actors want to be alone

Your room is still and soft
As a jeweler's

Incidental music
Coming down the hall
Remember when I never
Had to wait for you at all
I wish my hands were yours
As I lay your keys on a magazine

Take me to LaGuardia
My baby's gonna pay for me

Bottle from the duty-free
I'll drink it all across the sea
Lay me down business class
Headphones and a sleeping mask

She's gonna pay for me
She's gonna pay for me

Brother, I wish you were home
Just tell me you're not alone
Call me back, I'm on a plane
I think I'm somewhere over Spain
I'm in the dark without the stars
I've never seen a black so dark
Thought I'd be above the rain
Somewhere on a higher plane

Oh, brother
I wish you were home
My brother
(I wish you were home)

Baby, you're asleep by now
You never stayed awake for me
You never waited up for me
No, you never waited up for me
Now there's nothing I can do
I lost you, but I beat the sound
Couldn't if I wanted to
The Concord doesn't turn around

Oh, brother
I wish you were home
My baby
Is in a room alone
My brother
I wish you were home
