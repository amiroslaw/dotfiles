I can't be me when I'm in front of you
I just can't be myself when I see you
Because you're very cute tonight
And I feel shy and sad and I
Look at you
And I think I love you
But you don't want me
And that is very clear
I should have noticed it for years
But I still want you but not as a friend
Because...

You're the man, I'm the girl,
We look good together
You with your hat, me with my boots
We are, we are, the dandy cowboys

I read today in a magazine
That men don't like girls who are
Shy and sad so now
I wear my magic smile, just for you
I put my magic boots, I ride my magic horse
I am so brave, I don't fear anything
I even feel gusts sprawling under my skirt,
I wrote all amends and give the money, to daddy
Because...

You're the man, I'm the girl,
We look good together
You with your hat, me with my boots
We are, we are, the dandy cowboys

And now I'm the richest girl in all the country
You call me 'baby' you say you want me
But honey, it's too late
Now I'm the queen of rodeo
You missed your chance
You're no longer my hero.

You're a bitchy dandy
You don't respect the rules
You stole my money
And ran away with your pony
And now I'm gonna kill you
I'll shoot you in the head
Now I'm gonna kill you
I'm gonna shoot you in the head
Because...

You're the man, I'm the girl,
We look good together
You with your hat, me with my boots
We are, we are, the dandy cowboys... the dandy cowboys

You didn't want me and that was very clear
I will never never forget it
But I still hope that hats and boots can get along together
I still hope that hats and boots can get along together
I still hope that hats and boots can get along together
I hope that we get along
